# Alexa Meal Plan Skill
An Alexa skill for simplifying meal plan budgeting at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania.

The goal is to be able to answer questions like, "how many meals should I spend today?" given the user's meal plan type (block plan or weekly plan) and current number of meals.

Unfortunately, information about a user's meal plan is not available to this program because Edinboro uses a proprietary system. So, a user has to open her GET app and tell the Alexa skill what meal plan type she has and how many meals she has.
